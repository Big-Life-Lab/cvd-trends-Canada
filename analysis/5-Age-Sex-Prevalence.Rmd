```{r Hypertension}
library(srvyr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

svy_design <- as_survey_design(.data=harmonized_combined, weights="WTS_M")
ht1 <-svy_design %>%
  group_by(year, CCC_071) %>%
  summarise(proportion = survey_mean()*100) %>%
  filter(CCC_071 == 1) %>% 
  select(-proportion_se)%>%
  spread(year, proportion) %>%
  mutate(diff = ((`2017` - `2001`) / `2001`*100))
rownames(ht1)[rownames(ht1)==1]="Hypertension"

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
