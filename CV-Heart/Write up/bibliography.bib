  abstract = {Objective: Evidence shows that recent immigrants are healthier than the native-born population, a phenomenon known as the healthy immigrant effect. With increasing duration of stay, this health gap significantly narrows as immigrants' health deteriorates to either resemble or become worse than the host population. However, little is known about the category of immigrants for whom this decline is most pronounced since the extant research largely considers immigrants as a homogeneous group, thus overlooking important racial/ethnic differences.Design: Using data from the 2014 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), we categorised immigrants by race/ethnicity and duration of stay in Canada and compared them to their native-born white Canadian counterparts on the likelihood of having a chronic health condition, using type 2 diabetes (T2D) as a case.Results: In the base model, recent visible minority (i.e. non-white or non-Caucasian) immigrants and recent white immigrants were less likely than the native-born white Canadian population to have T2D (recent visible minority immigrants OR\,=\,0.46, CI\,=\,0.27-0.79, p\,=\,0.005; recent white immigrants OR\,=\,0.26, CI\,=\,0.11-0.64, p\,=\,0.003). The odds of having T2D were significantly higher for long-term immigrants than the native-born white Canadian population (long-term visible minority immigrants OR\,=\,1.59, CI\,=\,1.27-2.00, p\,=\,0.000; long-term white immigrants OR\,=\,1.74, CI\,=\,1.44-2.10, p\,=\,0.000). In the multivariate model, long-term visible minority immigrants were about 2.3 times more likely than their white Canadian born counterparts to have T2D (CI\,=\,1.86-2.96, p\,=\,0.000). Long-term visible minority immigrants were about 2.1 times more likely than long-term white immigrants to have T2D (CI\,=\,1.49-2.94, p\,=\,0.000)Conclusion: Immigrants' health deterioration varies significantly across ethnic categories in Canada. Interventions for facilitating the integration of visible minority immigrants may help reduce these health inequities.},

In the present study, the associations between the increase in body mass index (BMI) and the increase rates of CVD and high blood pressure (HBP) in the states of Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Colorado are examined using regression analysis and by means of neural network models for obesity and HBP. Data from Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were obtained and analyzed for obesity rates, percent of myocardial infarction, stroke, and HBP from 2005\textendash 2009. Results of this study showed a low association between obesity and myocardial infarction rates (R2=0.067); a moderate association with stroke rates (R2=0.462); and a strong association with HBP rates (R2=0.811). The highest rates of obesity, CVD, and HBP were found in Mississippi, while Colorado had the lowest rates. Maintaining healthy weight helps reduce the risks of developing CVD.},

  abstract = {For over 30 years, Canadian provinces have provided universal public insurance for hospital and physician care; however, evidence points to persisting socio-economic inequity in healthcare use. Because provinces hold the responsibility for planning and funding most publicly insured health services, there is some variation in health system characteristics. In the context of such variation, this study systematically investigated equity in healthcare use across the provinces. Drawing on the 2003 Canadian Community Health Survey, the author applied the indirect standardization approach to create an index of needs-adjusted inequity in the probability, total and conditional number of GP, specialist, hospital and dentist visits. Results reveal some variation in inequity across provinces; however, national trends show pro-rich inequity in the probability of a GP, specialist and dentist visit, and no significant evidence of inequity in inpatient care. Aside from income, the main socio-economic factors associated with inequity are education, complementary insurance for prescription drugs and dental care and, in some cases, region of residence. When total (and conditional) number of visits are examined, the pro-rich inequity in GP care disappears in all provinces. Differences in the extent of and contributors to inequity that are observed across the provinces suggest a need for more in-depth provincial policy analyses.},

  abstract = {Background There is growing evidence that cardiovascular risk profiles differ markedly across Canada's 4 major ethnic groups, namely White, South Asian, Chinese, and Black; however, the impact of long-term Canadian residency on cardiovascular risk within and across these ethnic groups is unknown. Methods Using pooled data from Statistics Canada's National Population and Canadian Community Health Surveys (1996-2007), we compared the age- and sex-standardized prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and diseases between recent immigrants ({$<$} 15 years in Canada) and long-term residents (immigrants who lived in Canada for {$\geq$} 15 years or people born in Canada) among White, South Asian, Chinese, and Black ethnic groups living in Ontario. We also calculated ethnic-specific attributable fraction (AF), defined as the proportion of risk that can be attributed to long-term Canadian residency. Results For all ethnic groups, cardiovascular risk factor profiles (ie, the percentage of people with {$\geq$} 2 major cardiovascular risk factors, ie, smoking, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension) were worse among those with longer duration of residency in Canada. The greatest change in recent immigrants vs long-term residents was observed in the Chinese group (2.2\% vs 5.2\%; AF 0.47) followed by the White (6.5\% vs 10.3\%; AF 0.36), Black (9.2\% vs 12.1\%; AF 0.17), and South Asian (7.7\% vs 8.2\%; AF 0.03) groups. The prevalence of cardiovascular disease did not differ significantly between recent immigrants and long-term residents, irrespective of ethnic group. Conclusions Our results suggest that cardiovascular disease prevention strategies must consider not only ethnicity, but also the level of acculturation within each ethnic group. R\'esum\'e Introduction Il y a de plus en plus de preuves d\'emontrant que les profils de risque cardiovasculaire diff\`erent de fa\c{c}on marqu\'ee entre les 4 groupes ethniques majeurs du Canada, c'est-\`a-dire les Blancs, les Sud-Asiatiques, les Chinois et les Noirs. Cependant, l'incidence de la r\'esidence canadienne \`a long terme sur le risque cardiovasculaire au sein et entre ces groupes ethniques est inconnue. M\'ethodes En utilisant les donn\'ees group\'ees de l'Enqu\^ete nationale sur la sant\'e de la population et l'Enqu\^ete sur la sant\'e dans les collectivit\'es canadiennes de Statistique Canada (1996-2007), nous avons compar\'e la pr\'evalence standardis\'ee selon l'\^age et le sexe des facteurs de risque cardiovasculaire et des maladies entre des immigrants r\'ecents ({$<$} 15 ans au Canada) et des r\'esidants \`a long terme (des immigrants qui ont v\'ecu au Canada pour {$\geq$} 15 ans ou des personnes qui sont n\'ees au Canada) parmi les groupes ethniques de Blancs, de Sud-Asiatiques, de Chinois et de Noirs vivant en Ontario. Nous avons aussi calcul\'e la fraction attribuable (FA) \`a la sp\'ecificit\'e ethnique, d\'efinie comme la proportion de risque qui peut \^etre attribu\'ee \`a la r\'esidence canadienne \`a long terme. R\'esultats Pour tous les groupes ethniques, les profils des facteurs de risque cardiovasculaire (c.-\`a-d. le pourcentage de personnes ayant {$\geq$} 2 facteurs de risque cardiovasculaire, soit le tabagisme, l'ob\'esit\'e, le diab\`ete et l'hypertension) ont \'et\'e pires parmi ceux ayant r\'esid\'e au Canada plus longuement. Le plus grand changement chez les immigrants r\'ecents par rapport aux r\'esidants \`a long terme a \'et\'e observ\'e dans le groupe de Chinois (2,2 \% vs 5,2 \%; FA 0,47) suivi par les Blancs (6,5 \% vs 10,3 \%; FA 0,36), les Noirs (9,2 \% vs 12,1 \%; FA 0,17), et les Sud-Asiatiques (7,7 \% vs 8,2 \%; FA 0,03). La pr\'evalence de la maladie cardiovasculaire n'a pas diff\'er\'e significativement entre les immigrants r\'ecents et les r\'esidants \`a long terme, sans distinction de groupe ethnique. Conclusions Nos r\'esultats sugg\`erent que les strat\'egies de pr\'evention de la maladie cardiovasculaire doivent consid\'erer non seulement l'ethnicit\'e, mais aussi le niveau d'acculturation au sein de chacun des groupes ethniques.},

Increased risk became evident at an early age (35\textendash 49 years) and was equally high or higher among women as compared with men. Lower socio-economic status and greater time living in Canada were also associated with increased risk for diabetes. Interpretation Recent immigrants, particularly women and immigrants of South Asian and African origin, are at high risk for diabetes compared with long-term residents of Ontario. This risk becomes evident at an early age, suggesting that effective programs for prevention of diabetes should be developed and targeted to immigrants in all age groups.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular disease remains the second leading cause of death in Canada. Monitoring and tracking the trends and disparities in major cardiovascular risk factors could provide benchmarks for future cardiovascular health strategies.To investigate the temporal trends, regional variations, and socioeconomic disparities in major cardiovascular risk factors in Canada from 2005 to 2016.This repeated cross-sectional survey study included adults aged 20 years and older from 6 Canadian Community Health Survey cycles between 2005 and 2016. Cardiovascular risk factors included hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and current smoking. Socioeconomic status was measured using equivalized household income. Data analysis was performed from September 2019 to April 2020.A total of 112 health regions and socioeconomic status.Age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and current smoking by year; health regions; and socioeconomic status. Absolute numbers were rounded to base 100 for confidentiality purposes, and percentages were based on weighted numbers. Slope index of inequality (SII) and relative index of inequality (RII) were calculated to assess absolute and relative socioeconomic inequalities, respectively.A total of 670\,000 respondents (329\,000 [49.1\%] men; 341\,000 [50.9\%] women) aged 20 years and older from 6 survey cycles were enrolled for this study. The largest age group was those aged 40 to 59 years (eg, 2005 cycle: 40.2\% [95\% CI, 39.9\%-40.6\%]). In the 2015/2016 cycle, the overall age- and sex-adjusted prevalence rates of hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and current smoking were 20.7\% (95\% CI, 20.4\%-21.1\%), 7.2\% (95\% CI, 7.0\%-7.5\%), 20.1\% (95\% CI, 19.7\%-20.6\%), and 17.8\% (95\% CI, 17.4\%-18.2\%), respectively. From 2005 to 2016, there was a significant increase in the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity (eg, prevalence of diabetes in both sexes, 2005: 5.8\% [95\% CI, 5.6\%-6.0\%]; 2015/2016: 7.2\% [95\% CI, 7.0\%-7.5\%]; P\,\&lt;\,.001) but a significant decrease in the prevalence of current smoking (both sexes, 2005: 22.1\% [95\% CI, 21.7\%-22.5\%]; 2015/2016: 17.8\% [95\% CI, 17.4\%-18.2\%]; P\,\&lt;\,.001). The prevalence of all the risk factors varied widely across health regions (eg, obesity, Vancouver Health Service Delivery Area: 6.7\% [95\% CI, 4.5\%-9.0\%]; Miramichi Area: 36.8\% [95\% CI, 27.3\%-46.3\%]). In addition to obesity among men, all risk factors tended to be more common among those with lower income (eg, prevalence of hypertension in both sexes, 2015/2016, lowest income group: 23.2\% [95\% CI, 22.4\%-24.0\%]; highest income group: 18.4\% [95\% CI, 17.7\%-19.1\%]). The SII and RII indicated consistent absolute and relative socioeconomic inequalities in hypertension, diabetes, and current smoking over time (eg, RII for hypertension in both sexes, 2005: 1.25; 95\% CI, 1.18-1.33; 2015/2016: 1.34; 95\% CI, 1.26-1.43). However, the phenomenon of absolute and relative socioeconomic inequalities in obesity was only observed among women (eg, RII for 2015/2016 for obesity in women; 1.74 (95\% CI, 1.56-1.93); men: 1.09; 95\% CI, 0.99-1.21).During the study period, the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity significantly increased, while the prevalence of current smoking significantly decreased. Geographic and socioeconomic gaps should be considered and addressed in future interventions and policies targeted at reducing these cardiovascular risk factors in Canada.},

  abstract = {Background Despite the wealth of frameworks on social determinants of health (SDOH), two current limitations include the relative superficial description of factors affecting health and a lack of focus on measuring health equity. The Health Equity Measurement Framework (HEMF) addresses these gaps by providing a more encompassing view of the multitude of SDOH and drivers of health service utilisation and by guiding quantitative analysis for public health surveillance and policy development. The objective of this paper is to present the HEMF, which was specifically designed to measure the direct and indirect effects of SDOH to support improved statistical modelling and measurement of health equity. Methods Based on a framework synthesis, the HEMF development involved initially integrating theoretical components from existing SDOH and health system utilisation frameworks. To further develop the framework, relevant publications on SDOH and health equity were identified through a literature review in major electronic databases. White and grey literatures were critically reviewed to identify strengths and gaps in the existing frameworks in order to inform the development of a unique health equity measurement framework. Finally, over a two-year period of consultation, scholars, health practitioners, and local policy influencers from municipal and provincial governments provided critical feedback on the framework regarding its components and causal relationships. Results This unified framework includes the socioeconomic, cultural, and political context, health policy context, social stratification, social location, material and social circumstances, environment, biological factors, health-related behaviours and beliefs, stress, quality of care, and healthcare utilisation. Alongside the HEMF's self-exploratory diagram showing the causal pathways in-depth, a number of examples are provided to illustrate the framework's usefulness in measuring and monitoring health equity as well as informing policy-making. Conclusions The HEMF highlights intervention areas to be influenced by strategic public policy for any organisation whose purview has an effect on health, including helping non-health sectors (such as education and labour) to better understand how their policies influence population health and perceive their role in health equity promotion. The HEMF recognises the complexity surrounding the SDOH and provides a clear, overarching direction for empirical work on health equity.

State chronic disease prevention practitioners are positioned to address these issues, yet little is known about how health equity is being incorporated into their work. The purpose of this study was to explore perceptions of health equity in a sample of state chronic disease practitioners., Methods: Participants were selected in conjunction with a related evaluation of the National Association of Chronic Disease Directors (NACDD) capacity-building and evidence-based efforts. Four states were chosen for study based on variance in capacity. Directors in each of the states were interviewed and using snowball sampling, 8\textendash 12 practitioner interviews were conducted in each state, digitally audio recorded and transcribed. Using a comparative coding technique, themes and analyses were developed., Results: Comments from the practitioners fell into three main and inter-related categories. First, they discussed the varying degrees of integration of health equity in their work. The second theme was collaboration and the importance of working within and outside of departments, as well as with the community. The third theme related to measurement and the need for better data that can be used to garner support and measure impact., Conclusion: Chronic disease practitioners can play an important role in achieving health equity. Integrating this work more fully into chronic disease prevention and health promotion, developing strategic partnerships, tracking efforts, and measuring impact will improve practice and ultimately population health.},

  abstract = {Fragmented investigation has masked the overall picture for causes of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Among the risk factors for CVD, high blood pressure (BP) is associated with the strongest evidence for causation and it has a high prevalence of exposure. Biologically, normal levels of BP are considerably lower than what has typically been characterized as normal in research and clinical practice. We propose that CVD is primarily caused by a right-sided shift in the population distribution of BP. Our view that BP is the predominant risk factor for CVD is based on conceptual postulates that have been tested in observational investigations and clinical trials. Large cohort studies have demonstrated that high BP is an important risk factor for heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, heart valve diseases, aortic syndromes, and dementia, in addition to coronary heart disease and stroke. In multivariate modeling, the presumed attributable risk of high BP for stroke and coronary heart disease has increased steadily with progressive use of lower values for normal BP. Meta-analysis of BP-lowering randomized controlled trials has demonstrated a benefit which is almost identical to that predicted from BP risk relationships in cohort studies. Prevention of age-related increases in BP would, in large part, reduce the vascular consequences usually attributed to aging, and together with intensive treatment of established hypertension would eliminate a large proportion of the population burden of BP-related CVD.},

  abstract = {Background: Immigration has been and remains an important force shaping Canadian demography and identity. Health characteristics associated with the movement of large numbers of people have current and future implications for migrants, health practitioners and health systems. We aimed to identify demographics and health status data for migrant populations in Canada. Methods: We systematically searched Ovid MEDLINE (1996\textendash 2009) and other relevant web-based databases to examine immigrant selection processes, demographic statistics, health status from population studies and health service implications associated with migration to Canada. Studies and data were selected based on relevance, use of recent data and quality. Results: Currently, immigration represents two-thirds of Canada's population growth, and immigrants make up more than 20\% of the nation's population. Both of these metrics are expected to increase. In general, newly arriving immigrants are healthier than the Canadian population, but over time there is a decline in this healthy immigrant effect. Immigrants and children born to new immigrants represent growing cohorts; in some metropolitan regions of Canada, they represent the majority of the patient population. Access to health services and health conditions of some migrant populations differ from patterns among Canadian-born patients, and these disparities have implications for preventive care and provision of health services. Interpretation: Because the health characteristics of some migrant populations vary according to their origin and experience, improved understanding of the scope and nature of the immigration process will help practitioners who will be increasingly involved in the care of immigrant populations, including prevention, early detection of disease and treatment.},

In Canada, equity is included as a policy goal in the Federal health legislation that governs healthcare systems. This study used ten cycles of the Statistics Canada Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS, n\,=\,664,548) to examine the trends in income-related inequities in healthcare utilization in Canada from 2000 to 2014. The horizontal inequity (HI) index was used to quantify inequity in healthcare utilization for general practitioner (GP) visits, specialist physician (SP) visits and hospital admissions (HA) nationally, in urban and rural areas, and for all provinces. Nationally, GP and SP visits show pro-rich inequity, while HA demonstrates pro-poor inequity. This pattern is consistent in the provincial and urban and rural areas results. Trend analysis suggested that inequity in GP visits became more pro-poor in New Brunswick, but more pro-rich in Prince Edward Island and Quebec. Despite the inclusion of equity as a main policy goal, this study demonstrated that inequity in healthcare utilization remains a persistent issue in the Canadian healthcare system.},

Dimensionality reduction helps in improving overall performance of machine learning algorithm. The application of classification algorithms on disease datasets yields promising results by developing adaptive, automated and intelligent diagnostic systems for chronic diseases. Parallel classification systems can be used to expedite the process and to enhance the computational efficiency of results. This work presents a comprehensive overview of various feature selection methods and their inherent pros and cons.

The MET concept represents a simple, practical, and easily understood procedure for expressing the energy cost of physical activities as a multiple of the resting metabolic rate. The energy cost of an activity can be determined by dividing the relative oxygen cost of the activity (ml O2/kg/min) x by 3.5. This article summarizes and presents energy expenditure values for numerous household and recreational activities in both METS and watts units. Also, the intensity levels (in METS) for selected exercise protocols are compared stage by stage. In spite of its limitations, the MET concept provides a convenient method to describe the functional capacity or exercise tolerance of an individual as determined from progressive exercise testing and to define a repertoire of physical activities in which a person may participate safely, without exceeding a prescribed intensity level.},

  abstract = {Objective To investigate how individual risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) (blood pressure, lipid levels, body mass index, waist and hip circumference, use of antihypertensive or hypolipidemic medication, and diagnosed diabetes) differ in people aged 46 years with different smoking behaviour and history. Methods This population-based cohort study is based on longitudinal data from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 project. Data were collected at the 31-year and 46-year follow-ups, when a total of 5038 and 5974 individuals participated in clinical examinations and questionnaires. Data from both follow-ups were available for 3548 participants. In addition to individual CVD risk factors, Framingham and Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) algorithms were used to assess the absolute risk of a CVD event within the next decade. Results The differences in individual risk factors for CVD reached statistical significance for some groups, but the differences were not consistent or clinically significant. There were no clinically significant differences in CVD risk as measured by Framingham or SCORE algorithms between never smokers, recent quitters and former smokers (7.5\%, 7.4\%, 8.1\% for men; 3.3\%, 3.0\%, 3.2\% for women; p{$<$}0.001). Conclusions The effect of past or present smoking on individual CVD risk parameters such as blood pressure and cholesterol seems to be of clinically minor significance in people aged 46 years. In other words, smoking seems to be above all an independent risk factor for CVD in the working-age population. Quitting smoking in working age may thus reduce calculated CVD risk nearly to the same level with people who have never smoked.},

  abstract = {Objective: To investigate how individual risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) (blood pressure, lipid levels, body mass index, waist and hip circumference, use of antihypertensive or hypolipidemic medication, and diagnosed diabetes) differ in people aged 46 years with different smoking behaviour and history. Methods: This population-based cohort study is based on longitudinal data from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 project. Data were collected at the 31-year and 46-year follow-ups, when a total of 5038 and 5974 individuals participated in clinical examinations and questionnaires. Data from both follow-ups were available for 3548 participants. In addition to individual CVD risk factors, Framingham and Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) algorithms were used to assess the absolute risk of a CVD event within the next decade. Results: The differences in individual risk factors for CVD reached statistical significance for some groups, but the differences were not consistent or clinically significant. There were no clinically significant differences in CVD risk as measured by Framingham or SCORE algorithms between never smokers, recent quitters and former smokers (7.5\%, 7.4\%, 8.1\% for men; 3.3\%, 3.0\%, 3.2\% for women; p{$<$}0.001). Conclusions: The effect of past or present smoking on individual CVD risk parameters such as blood pressure and cholesterol seems to be of clinically minor significance in people aged 46 years. In other words, smoking seems to be above all an independent risk factor for CVD in the working-age population. Quitting smoking in working age may thus reduce calculated CVD risk nearly to the same level with people who have never smoked.},

We aimed to estimate the public health impact of increases in walking as a means of diabetes prevention and health care cost savings attributable to diabetes. We applied the validated Diabetes Population Risk Tool (DPoRT) to the 2015/16 Canadian Community Health Survey for adults aged 18\textendash 64, living in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton area, Ontario, Canada. DPoRT was used to generate three population-level scenarios involving increases in walking among individuals with low physical activity levels, low daily step counts and high dependency on non-active forms of travel, compared to a baseline scenario (no change in walking rates). We estimated number of diabetes cases prevented and health care costs saved in each scenario compared with the baseline. Each of the three scenarios predicted a considerable reduction in diabetes and related health care cost savings. In order of impact, the largest population benefits were predicted from targeting populations with low physical activity levels, low daily step counts, and non active transport use. Population increases of walking by 25 min each week was predicted to prevent up to 10.4 thousand diabetes cases and generate CAD 74.4 million in health care cost savings in 10 years. Diabetes reductions and cost savings were projected to be higher if increases of 150 min of walking per week could be achieved at the population-level (up to 54.3 thousand diabetes cases prevented and CAD 386.9 million in health care cost savings). Policy, programming, and community designs that achieve modest increases in population walking could translate to meaningful reductions in the diabetes burden and cost savings to the health care system.},

Results Unawareness of CVD risk factors is high among all groups, but tends to be higher among foreign-born English and non-English speaking participants than among US-born participants. Adjusting for demographic factors and access to health care, foreign-born participants are more likely to be unaware of their hypertension and overweight than US-born participants. Conclusion Immigrants are more likely than those born in the US to be unaware of their CVD risk factors, and may therefore be less motivated to seek treatment and modify their behavior to prevent negative CVD outcomes.},

We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to predict the effect of alcohol consumption on 8 cardiovascular diseases. Methods: Up to 94 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were used as instrumental variables for alcohol consumption. Genetic association estimates for cardiovascular diseases were obtained from large-scale consortia and UK Biobank. Analyses were conducted using the inverse variance\textendash weighted, weighted median, MR-PRESSO, MR-Egger, and multivariable MR methods. Results: Genetically predicted alcohol consumption was consistently associated with stroke and peripheral artery disease across the different analyses. The odds ratios (ORs) per 1-SD increase of log-transformed alcoholic drinks per week were 1.27 ([95\% CI, 1.12\textendash 1.45] P=2.87\texttimes 10-4) for stroke and 3.05 ([95\% CI, 1.92\textendash 4.85] P=2.30\texttimes 10-6) for peripheral artery disease in the inverse variance\textendash weighted analysis. There was some evidence for positive associations of genetically predicted alcohol consumption with coronary artery disease (OR, 1.16 [95\% CI, 1.00\textendash 1.36]; P=0.052), atrial fibrillation (OR, 1.17 [95\% CI, 1.00\textendash 1.37]; P=0.050), and abdominal aortic aneurysm (OR, 2.60 [95\% CI, 1.15\textendash 5.89]; P=0.022) in the inverse variance\textendash weighted analysis.

Ideal cardiovascular health, a concept well supported in the literature, is defined by the presence of both ideal health behaviors (nonsmoking, body mass index {$<$}25 kg/m2, physical activity at goal levels, and pursuit of a diet consistent with current guideline recommendations) and ideal health factors (untreated total cholesterol {$<$}200 mg/dL, untreated blood pressure {$<$}120/{$<$}80 mm Hg, and fasting blood glucose {$<$}100 mg/dL). Appropriate levels for children are also provided. With the use of levels that span the entire range of the same metrics, cardiovascular health status for the whole population is defined as poor, intermediate, or ideal. These metrics will be monitored to determine the changing prevalence of cardiovascular health status and define achievement of the Impact Goal. In addition, the committee recommends goals for further reductions in cardiovascular disease and stroke mortality. Thus, the committee recommends the following Impact Goals: ``By 2020, to improve the cardiovascular health of all Americans by 20\% while reducing deaths from cardiovascular diseases and stroke by 20\%.'' These goals will require new strategic directions for the American Heart Association in its research, clinical, public health, and advocacy programs for cardiovascular health promotion and disease prevention in the next decade and beyond.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Medical screening plays a role in explaining the healthy immigrant effect (HIE) among immigrants newly landed in Canada. The 2002 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) modernized immigration selection by exempting certain immigrant categories (e.g., refugees and certain family-class immigrants) from inadmissibility on health grounds. This study examines the HIE in the IRPA era by sex, with a focus on those categories affected by the IRPA. DATA AND METHODS: The linked Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS)-Longitudinal Immigration Database (IMDB) was used to compare sex-specific age-standardized proportions of four health measures between Canadian-born and immigrants aged 20 to 65, overall and by duration since landing. Immigrants who landed within three years of the surveys from 2007 to 2014 were examined by sex and immigrant category. Logistic regression was used to further compare the HIE in the same immigrant sub-groups to the Canadian-born, controlling for age and selected confounders. RESULTS: This study found the HIE in most selected measures for immigrants overall, as well as for those recent immigrants arriving under the IRPA, including the family class. Among refugees, the HIE was observed only in less severe chronic conditions; this was especially the case among females. As expected, a strong HIE was observed among economic-class principal applicants. These health advantages persisted even after adjustment for socioeconomic and health factors. For self-rated health, the advantage existed for some groups only after full adjustment. DISCUSSION: This study is a first look at the healthy immigrant effect under the 2002 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act by immigration category. Results corroborate the existing literature on the presence of the HIE among immigrants: the HIE was found to be much weaker among refugees.},

The availability of health surveys linked to health care provides population-based estimates of direct healthcare costs. We estimated health behaviour and socioeconomic-attribute healthcare costs, and how these have changed during a period when government policies have aimed to reduce their burden.~ Methods: The Ontario samples of the Canadian Community Health Surveys (conducted in 2003, 2005, and 2007-2008) were linked at the individual level to all records of health care use of publicly funded healthcare. Generalized linear models were estimated with a negative binomial distribution to ascertain the relationship of health behaviours and socioeconomic risk factors on health care costs. The multivariable cost model was applied to unlinked, Ontario CCHS samples for each year from 2004 to 2013 to examine the evolution of health behaviour and socioeconomic-attributable direct health care expenditures over a 10-year period. Results: We included 80,749 respondents, aged 25 years and older, and 312,952 person-years of follow-up. The cost model was applied to 200,324 respondents aged 25 years and older (CCHS 2004 to 2013). During the 10-year period from 2004 to 2013, smoking, unhealthy alcohol consumption, poor diet and physical inactivity attributed to 22\% of Ontario's direct health care costs. Ontarians in the most disadvantaged socioeconomic position contributed to 15\% of the province's direct health care costs. Combined, these health behaviour and socioeconomic risk factors were associated with 34\% (\$134 billion) of direct health care costs (2004 to 2013). Over this time period, we estimated a 1.9\% reduction in health care expenditure (\$5.0 billion) attributable to improvements in some health behaviours, most importantly reduced rates of smoking. Conclusions: Adverse health behaviours and socioeconomic position cause a large direct health care system cost burden.},

We assessed the Canadian burden attributable to these behaviours by developing, validating, and applying a multivariable predictive model for risk of all-cause death. Methods A predictive algorithm for 5 y risk of death\textemdash the Mortality Population Risk Tool (MPoRT)\textemdash was developed and validated using the 2001 to 2008 Canadian Community Health Surveys. There were approximately 1 million person-years of follow-up and 9,900 deaths in the development and validation datasets. After validation, MPoRT was used to predict future mortality and estimate the burden of smoking, alcohol, physical inactivity, and poor diet in the presence of sociodemographic and other risk factors using the 2010 national survey (approximately 90,000 respondents). Canadian period life tables were generated using predicted risk of death from MPoRT. The burden of behavioural risk factors attributable to life expectancy was estimated using hazard ratios from the MPoRT risk model. Findings The MPoRT 5 y mortality risk algorithms were discriminating (C-statistic: males 0.874 [95\% CI: 0.867\textendash 0.881]; females 0.875 [0.868\textendash 0.882]) and well calibrated in all 58 predefined subgroups. Discrimination was maintained or improved in the validation cohorts. For the 2010 Canadian population, unhealthy behaviour attributable life expectancy lost was 6.0 years for both men and women (for men 95\% CI: 5.8 to 6.3 for women 5.8 to 6.2). The Canadian life expectancy associated with health behaviour recommendations was 17.9 years (95\% CI: 17.7 to 18.1) greater for people with the most favourable risk profile compared to those with the least favourable risk profile (88.2 years versus 70.3 years). Smoking, by itself, was associated with 32\% to 39\% of the difference in life expectancy across social groups (by education achieved or neighbourhood deprivation). Conclusions Multivariable predictive algorithms such as MPoRT can be used to assess health burdens for sociodemographic groups or for small changes in population exposure to risks, thereby addressing some limitations of more commonly used measurement approaches. Unhealthy behaviours have a substantial collective burden on the life expectancy of the Canadian population.},

However, it is unclear whether this trend will continue. Our objective was to examine future risk by projecting trends in preventable risk factors in Canada to 2021. Methods We created a population-based microsimulation model using national data on births, deaths and migration; socioeconomic data; cardiovascular disease risk factors; and algorithms for changes in these risk factors (based on sociodemographic characteristics and previous cardiovascular disease risk). An initial population of 22.5 million people, representing the Canadian adult population in 2001, had 13 characteristics including the risk factors used in clinical risk prediction. There were 6.1 million potential exposure profiles for each person each year. Outcome measures included annual prevalence of risk factors (smoking, obesity, diabetes, hypertension and lipid levels) and of co-occurring risks. Results From 2003 to 2009, the projected risks of cardiovascular disease based on the microsimulation model closely approximated those based on national surveys. Except for obesity and diabetes, all risk factors were projected to decrease through to 2021. The largest projected decreases were for the prevalence of smoking (from 25.7\% in 2001 to 17.7\% in 2021) and uncontrolled hypertension (from 16.1\% to 10.8\%). Between 2015 and 2017, obesity was projected to surpass smoking as the most prevalent risk factor. Interpretation Risks of cardiovascular disease are projected to decrease modestly in Canada, leading to a likely continuing decline in its incidence.},

  abstract = {Objectives We applied the validated Obesity Population Risk Tool (OPoRT) to estimate the future burden of obesity in Canada using baseline risk factors attained through routinely collected survey data. Methods OPoRT was developed using logistic regression with sex-specific generalized estimating equations to predict the 10-year prevalence of obesity (outcome BMI\,{$\geq$}\,30.0) among adults 18 and older. The algorithm includes 17 predictive factors, including socio-demographic and health behavioural characteristics. OPoRT demonstrated excellent discrimination (C-statistic\,{$\geq$}\,0.89) and achieved calibration. We applied OPoRT to Canadian Community Health Survey (2013/14) data to predict the~future prevalence of obesity in Canada for a variety of population subgroups. Results The predicted burden of obesity grew from 261 cases per 1000 in 2013/14 to 326 cases per 1000 in 2023/24 corresponding to a total of 8.54 million individuals with obesity. The burden is expected to be higher among males (347 cases per 1000) than females (305 cases per 1000). Individuals aged 35\textendash 49 had the highest predicted burden of obesity (374 cases per 1000) and the largest number of predicted cases (2.42 million), while individuals in the {$\geq$}\,65 age group had the lowest predicted burden (236 cases per 1000). The number of individuals with obesity per 1000 is highest among those severely food insecure (452 cases per 1000), compared with food secure individuals (324 cases per 1000). Conclusions OPoRT can be used to estimate the future population burden of obesity, to identify priority subgroups at an elevated risk. Burden estimates should be reflected in approaches to curb the future burden of obesity.

  abstract = {Background: The goal of predictive modelling is to identify the likelihood of future events, such as the predictive modelling used in climate science to forecast weather patterns and significant weather occurrences. In public health, increasingly sophisticated predictive models are used to predict health events in patients and to screen high risk individuals, such as for cardiovascular disease and breast cancer. Although causal modelling is frequently used in epidemiology to identify risk factors, predictive modelling provides highly useful information for individual risk prediction and for informing courses of treatment. Such predictive knowledge is often of great utility to physicians, counsellors, health education specialists, policymakers or other professionals, who may then advice course correction or interventions to prevent adverse health outcomes from occurring. In this manuscript, we use an example dataset that documents farm vehicle crashes and conventional statistical methods to forecast the risk of an injury or death in a farm vehicle crash for a specific individual or a scenario. Results: Using data from 7094 farm crashes that occurred between 2005 and 2010 in nine mid-western states, we demonstrate and discuss predictive model fitting approaches, model validation techniques using external datasets, and the calculation and interpretation of predicted probabilities. We then developed two automated risk prediction tools using readily available software packages. We discuss best practices and common limitations associated with predictive models built from observational datasets. Conclusions: Predictive analysis offers tools that could aid the decision making of policymakers, physicians, and environmental health practitioners to improve public health.},

Methods We analyzed a cohort of 149,262 adults in the 2000\textendash 2010 Canadian Community Health Surveys, linked to vital statistics data to ascertain deaths until December 31, 2015. The strength of the association between behaviors (smoking, body mass index, physical inactivity, and alcohol consumption) and all-cause and premature mortality was estimated using sex-specific Cox proportional hazards models. We estimated the proportion of deaths from causes amenable to the health system by behavior. Results After full adjustment, hazard ratios (95\% confidence interval) for premature mortality were significantly increased for heavy smokers versus nonsmokers [males: 5.48 (4.55\textendash 6.60); females 4.45 (3.49\textendash 5.66)]; obese class III versus normal weight [males: 2.47 (1.76\textendash 3.48); females: 1.73 (1.29\textendash 2.31)]; and physically inactive versus active [males: 1.25 (1.07\textendash 1.45); females: 1.70 (1.41\textendash 2.04)]. In both sexes, a disproportionate burden of amenable deaths were experienced by heavy smokers, severely obese, physically inactive, and heavy drinkers. Conclusions The findings emphasize the importance of prevention to reduce the prevalence of risk behaviors that contribute to a large burden of premature deaths that are amenable to the health system.},

Using data from the National Longitudinal Mortality Study, 1979\-1989, we estimated, for major US racial and ethnic groups, mortality risks of immigrants relative to those of the US-born. The Cox regression model was used to adjust mortality differentials by age, sex, marital status, rural/urban residence, education, and family income. Logistic regression was fitted to the National Health Interview Survey data to determine whether health status and behaviors vary among ethnic-immigrant groups and by length of US residence. Compared with US-born whites of equivalent socioeconomic and demographic background, foreign-born blacks, Hispanics, and Asians/Pacific Islanders (APIs), US-born APIs, US-born Hispanics, and foreign-born whites had, respectively, 48\%, 45\%, 43\%, 32\%, 26\%, and 16\% lower mortality risks. While American Indians did not differ significantly from US-born whites, US-born blacks had an 8\% higher mortality risk. Black and Hispanic immigrants experienced, respectively, 52\% and 26\% lower mortality risks than their US-born counterparts. Considerable differentials were also found in mortality for cancer, cardiovascular, respiratory, infectious disease, and injury, and in morbidity and health behaviors, with API and Hispanic immigrants generally experiencing the lowest risks. Consistent with the acculturation hypothesis, immigrants' risks of smoking, obesity, hypertension, and chronic condition, although substantially lower than those for the US-born, increased with increasing length of US residence. Given the substantial nativity differences in health status and mortality, future waves of immigrants of diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds will likely have a sizeable impact on the overall health, disease, and mortality patterns in the United States.}

Heavy episodic drinking (HED), however, negates these beneficial effects and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The impact of age on the health effects of episodic drinking has not been evaluated.Objective: to examine the association between alcohol volume and pattern of consumption on the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality across the lifespan.Design and Setting: prospective, community-based cohort study of adults in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.Subjects: a total of 1,154 participants (580 men and 574 women) aged 18\textendash 64 surveyed at baseline (1990\textendash 91) on alcohol consumption levels and pattern of use.Methods: usual alcohol consumption was measured using a quantity\textendash frequency approach. HED was estimated by asking participants how often they consumed eight or more drinks in one sitting in the past year. Questions were asked separately for wine, beer and spirits. Surveillance for cardiovascular events was conducted for 10 years (i.e. up to age 74 years). Diagnoses of CVD were obtained via health utilization records. Cox proportional hazard models were derived for both genders and for `young adults' (baseline age 18\textendash 34), `middle-aged adults' (baseline age 35\textendash 49) and `older adults' (baseline 50\textendash 64). Models were adjusted for marital status, cigarette smoking status and educational level.Results: Reduced risk of CVD was associated with usual consumption, whereas an increased risk was associated with HED. Among male usual drinkers, cardioprotection was afforded only to middle and older age groups. The benefits of regular consumption were seen only in the youngest age group among women. The heaviest usual consumption category was associated with a decreased risk of CVD in men. Heavy episodic drinking increased the risk of coronary heart disease in middle-aged men and was marginally significant in middle-aged women. Risk of hypertension was elevated in older men with heavy episodic drinking.Conclusions: The well-established relationship between regular alcohol consumption and decreased risk of CVD may not become evident until middle age or older in men. Women may benefit from usual consumption at a much younger age. In both sexes, however, these beneficial effects of alcohol use are negated when alcohol is consumed in a heavy episodic drinking pattern, particularly for middle-aged and older men.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This paper provides an update of the prevalence of important cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in subgroups of the Canadian population. To improve awareness of the impact of CVD risk factor variations on disease burden, smoking-attributable mortality (SAM) has been estimated for the first time for each health region in Canada. METHODS: The 2000/01 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) was used to estimate the prevalence of current smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, low income, diabetes and hypertension. Combining smoking prevalence data from the 2000/01 CCHS, mortality data from the 1995 to 1997 Canadian Mortality Database, and relative risk estimates (relating smoking and smoking-associated deaths) from the American Cancer Society's Cancer Prevention Study II, SAM values were generated using population-attributable risk techniques. RESULTS: Based on self-reported data, the 2000/01 CCHS shows that 26.0\% of Canadians currently smoke, 14.9\% are obese, 53.5\% are physically inactive, 11.3\% have low income, 13.0\% have hypertension and 4.2\% have diabetes. Cardiovascular and all-cause SAM were estimated at 18,209 and 44,271 annual deaths, and contributed to 23\% and 22\% of total CVD and all-cause mortality in Canada, respectively. There are large variations in the prevalence of CVD risk factors and in SAM estimates between sexes and across age groups and geographic regions. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of potentially modifiable CVD risk factors and the large variation that exists between subgroups of the Canadian population suggest that the burden of CVD could be reduced through risk factor modification. While prevalence data for risk factors in a population give an initial understanding of some of the contributing causes of a disease, the actual burden of disease caused by a risk factor is also modified by the magnitude of the increased risk to mortality and morbidity, and is best represented by its estimated attributable mortality and morbidity.},

  abstract = {Chronic diseases are highly important for the future level and distribution of health and well-being in western societies. Consequently, it seems pertinent to assess not only efficiency of chronic care but also its impact on health equity. However, operationalisation of health equity has proven a challenging task. Challenges include identifying a relevant and measurable evaluative space. Various schools of thought in health economics have identified different outcomes of interest for equity assessment, with capabilities as a proposed alternative to more conventional economic conceptualisations. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the conceptualisation of health equity evaluation in the context of chronic disease management. We do this by firstly introducing an equity enquiry framework incorporating the capabilities approach. Secondly, we demonstrate the application and relevance of this framework through a content analysis of equity-related principles and aims in national chronic disease management guidelines and the national diabetes action plan in Denmark. Finally, we discuss how conceptualisations of equity focused on capabilities may be used in evaluation by scoping relevant operationalisations. A promising way forward in the context of chronic care evaluation may emerge from a combination of concepts of capabilities developed in economics, health sciences and psychology.},

  abstract = {This review of the epidemiological evidence regarding physical activity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) provides substantial evidence from many different populations that leisure time physical activity is associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and cardiovascular mortality in both men and women and in middle-aged and older individuals. Physical activity appears to be a critical factor in both primary and secondary prevention of CHD. The studies indicate a dose-response relationship between overall physical activity and CVD, which is linear at least up to a certain level of activity. Prospective studies suggest that physical activity is also associated with reduced risk of stroke. The mechanisms underlying the protective effect of physical activity on CVD are still unclear. In recent years, the view that physical activity has to be vigorous to achieve a reduction in risk of CHD has been questioned. Overall, the evidence points to the benefit of continued regular moderate physical activity which does not need to be strenuous or prolonged and includes daily leisure activities such as walking or gardening which are readily attainable by large sections of the population. Taking up regular light or moderate physical activity in middle or older age confers significant benefit for CVD and all-cause mortality.},

  abstract = {Population-based survey data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) is commonly used by health system organizations to estimate the prevalence of behavioral, health status, and other risk factors, in order to inform health needs and priorities for people in different populations. However, two issues typically present challenges. First, a single cycle of the CCHS may not have a large enough sample size to reliably compute estimates for a small region or population. Second, proportion estimates between two populations might be distorted by the different underlying age structure of the two groups. Thomas and Wannell (2009) discuss a `pooled approach' method for combining CCHS cycles, in order to increase the power and sample size for analysis. We will further explore the application of this pooled approach and demonstrate how to produce age-standardized proportion estimates and confidence intervals generated with bootstrap weights from pooled CCHS data using procedures in SAS.},
