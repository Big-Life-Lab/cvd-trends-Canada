**Background:** The intersection of immigration and heart health is complex. There is a variation within the growing immigrant population with respect to education, income, and socioeconomic position. With the recent advancements in heart disease interventions and prevention in the past few decades, sustained efforts are required to further decrease the development of health disease risk factors. Many risk factors related to cardiovascular disease and stroke can be prevented by changes in daily life and in health policy. In recognizing the prevalence in risk factors across sexes, different age groups, ethnic groups, and broad geographical regions, health professionals and program planners can focus their efforts on specific at-risk groups of the population.

**Objective:** To examine national trends in heart disease and risk factors related to cardiovascular disease from 2001 to 2018.

**Methods:** Canadian Community Health Surveys (CCHS) from 2001 to 2018 were combined using a harmonization package, cchsflow. Respondents age 12 years and older were examined for cardiovascular disease risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, smoking, activity levels, and obesity. The prevalence of each risk factor and combinations of risk factors were examined and compared between provinces and immigrant and Canadian-born status.

**Results:** During the study period, the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and obesity increased for all groups in Canada. Trends in diabetes, hypertension, and obesity were consistent for all provinces. We expect to see significant variations in the burden of cardiovascular risk factors among immigrant and native-born populations.

**Conclusion:** Our study hopes to demonstrate the important trends in risk behaviours and factors related to cardiovascular disease in Canadians and the growing immigrant population. This study can be used by policymakers to develop evidence-based healthcare interventions, targeted health promotion programs, and to bridge the disparities for at-risk groups with cardiovascular disease in Canada.
